# Structural Patterns

Focus: Combination of classes and objects.

Goal:
+ Combine classes or objects into larger structures to simplify system design and improve code maintainability.
+ Achieve new functionalities or change system behavior through different combination methods.
+ Extend system functionality without changing existing code.

Common Patterns:
Adapter: Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect, allowing classes that are originally incompatible to work together.

Bridge: Decouple the abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Composite: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and composite objects uniformly.

Decorator: Dynamically add additional responsibilities to an object without modifying its original class.

Facade: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.

Flyweight: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

Proxy: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.


## Adapter
The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class, a 3rd-party class or any other class with a weird interface.

You could extend each subclass and put the missing functionality into new child classes. However, youâ€™ll need to duplicate the code across all of these new classes, which smells really bad.
